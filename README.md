![Project for my writing course](https://i.imgur.com/9ngFgE0.jpg)
## Notes
1. I don't know why I went through all these stuff for a stupid writing class (and got a B despite putting a good amount of time into it)
2. Project uses PIXI.js and another polygon generator library, everything else is written by myself, besides the images I stole from the Internet
