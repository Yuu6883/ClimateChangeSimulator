# ClimateChangeSimulator

## Notes
1. I don't know why I went through all these stuff for a stupid writing class (and got B despite putting a good amount of time into it, compared to my friend who got A by making a google slide and copied some lines from some random websites)
2. I used PIXI.js and another polygon generator library, wrote everything else myself. (besides the images I stole from the Internet)
